        <p>Details about lore and backstory.</p>
        <p>Ancient gods, kings, and guardians fought to control the fate of the land, leaving behind legends, ruins, and relics that still influence the present.

The First Age was an era of harmony, guided by the light of Aeloria, Goddess of Dawn. But jealousy and ambition soon corrupted men and sorcerers alike. The peace shattered when Malrik the Dark Seer uncovered forbidden magic, unleashing a curse that spread across kingdoms.</p>
       <p>To save what remained, Kaelorn the Fallen King united the realms for one last stand. Though his army defeated Malrik, betrayal from within cost him his throne — and his life. The war ended, but the scars on the land and its people never healed.

Now, centuries later, whispers of the ancient curse are returning. Forest spirits once protected by Serenya the Eternal Guardian stir restlessly, and long-forgotten cults seek to revive Malrik’s dark power. The heroes of today must uncover the truth of the past, for the destiny of the world is tied to this forgotten history.</p>  <img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.Gh_vT0rUX-Sk4V3r1R1VXQHaHa?w=164&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=7&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7&rm=3" alt="Character" class="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Strangest-DD-Lore-For-Character-Backstory.jpg">
